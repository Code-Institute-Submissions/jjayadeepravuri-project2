## Testing
### Code Validation

At the completion , I used the following websites to check my code for syntax errors:

* [HTML]
    - no errors found
* [CSS]
    - no errors found
* [JavaScript]
    - The Javascript files were validated through JSHint. There were multiple warnings for: ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz). After some research online, I saw that I need to add /*jshint esversion: 6 */ on the top of the JS file and the warning will disappear. I also had a few warnings for missing semi-colans which have also been rectified.
