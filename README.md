Once on the game page, users will be faced with the first question from the quiz. Every time they click on an answer, the next question will load. Once 10 questions have been answered, the restart button will appear to play the game again or they can go home by clicking on the logo, which will redirect them to the home page.

## Testing
### Code Validation

At the completion , I used the following websites to check my code for syntax errors:

* [HTML]
    - no errors found
* [CSS]
    - no errors found
* [JavaScript]
    - The Javascript files were validated through JSHint. There were multiple warnings for: ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz). After some research online, I saw that I need to add /*jshint esversion: 6 */ on the top of the JS file and the warning will disappear. I also had a few warnings for missing semi-colans which have also been rectified.
